# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study
Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study!
In this case study, you'll step into the shoes of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. Your role is to analyze historical bike trip data to answer key business questions and provide insights that will inform the company's marketing strategy.

## Scenario
Cyclistic is a bike-share program with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations across Chicago.

The majority of riders use traditional bikes for leisure, while about 30% use them for daily commuting.

Your manager, Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, has tasked you with understanding the differences in bike usage between annual members and casual riders. The goal is to design a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. Your recommendations will be presented to Cyclistic's executive team for approval.
